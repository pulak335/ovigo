            Shundorban is the lungs of Bangladesh and we the people of
            Bangladesh must take care this beautiful and magnificent natural
            gift. I appreciate lately The forest department did a splendid job
            to ensure the mangrove forest can rest peacefully and breed itself.
            This is the {"tiger's"} den but we keep staying greedy and kill
            them. Let us be human and allow this natural resources to stay on
            their own course and at the end it will return back as benifit for
            mankind.

            The most popular times to visit Sundarbans are November, December,
            January, February and months. Because the weather is cool and calm
            during these four months of winter. Chances of rain and clouds are
            very low. Enjoy the nature of the Sundarbans along with a wonderful
            opportunity to see wildlife up close. If you are lucky, you may meet
            the world famous Royal Bengal Tiger during this time.
